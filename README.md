This is a program written in python to change the wallpaper of my desktop every three minutes. I have used the unsplash api to download random images for my desktop wallpaper.
Python modules used in this project:-
1)urllib.request - this module is being used to download random images and save it to pic.jpg.
2)PIL - this module is being used for loading the images so that we can resize it.
3)requests - this module is being used to get the json api from the url.
4)ctypes - this module is being used for changing the wallpaper of my desktop.
5)time - this module is being used to change the wallpaper after every 3 minutes.
6)resizeumage - this module is being used to resize the downloaded inmage so that it fits my desktop backround properly.
